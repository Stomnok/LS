# how to use testing script
First you need to create executable file from cpp sources. Default script means that it is 'makeLS' in the same folder as scripts. Then start test_script.py and input order (power of 2). Then change value of n in calculate_correlation.py to result order of LS (e.g. 1024, not 10). Run calculate_correlation.py to get median Spearman correlation to every symbol positions in output
